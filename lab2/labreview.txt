Write a short Python script to ask the user to provide their shoe size at the keyboard, and store the result in an integer object called shoeSize.
Add codes to the previous Python script to display the shoe size entered using the same integer object created. (For example: Your shoe size is: 16).

#!/usr/bin/env python3

shoeSize = input('What is your shoe size?')
print('Your shoe size is: ' + shoeSize)

What is the purpose of importing special module from your system?
The purpose of importing a special module is so that we can get access to the code in that module.

Write a short Python script to display two arguments from running your Python script.

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

arg1 = sys.argv[1]
arg2 = sys.argv[2]

print('The first argument is: ' + arg1)
print('The second argument is ' + arg2)

For example if your Python script was called myscript.py and you issued the command:
python myscript.py happy afternoon, you would get the following output:

The first argument is: happy
The second argument is afternoon


What is the purpose of using an if statement?
The purpose of an if statement is to set a condition on which the code following the statement will run under

What is the purpose of using an if-else statement?
The purpose of an if-else statement is to extend the existing functionality of an existing if statement

Write a short Python script which terminates the execution of the Python script if there are not exactly 3 arguments given at the command line.
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

arguments = len(sys.argv)

if arguments != 4:
    sys.exit()


What is the purpose of an if-elif-else statement?


Write a Python script to prompt the user for a course mark (no error checking is required... you can assume that the input will be a valid mark from 0 to 100). Use an if-elif-else statement to convert the mark to a letter grade. For simplicity, you don't have to worry about D+, C+, B+, or A+

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import sys

mark = sys.argv[1]

if mark < 60:
    grade = 'D'
elif mark >= 60 and mark < 70:
    grade = 'C'
elif mark >= 70 and mark < 80:
    grade = 'B'
else:
    grade = 'A'

print('Your grade is: ' + grade)

Write a Python script to print the text I love Python twenty times (on a separate line).
#!/usr/bin/env python3

count = 0

while count != 20
    print('I love Python')
    count = count + 1


Identify and list the Python 3 keywords used in this lab.


Identify and list the Python 3 built-in functions used in this lab. (hint: the functions provided by the __builtins__ module)

INTERESTING CHALLENGE: Perform a Netsearch to see how you can write Python code to perform error-checking (using a loop) to force a user to enter a number for the shoe size script (created in question #2). There are two things to consider:
A number as opposed to a string
It has to be an acceptable range from 1 to 20

#!/usr/bin/env python3


while True:
    try:
        shoeSize = int(input('What is your shoe size?'))
            if shoeSize < 1 or shoeSize > 20:
                print('Please enter a valid shoe size(1 to 20)')
                continue
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError('Please enter a valid shoe size(1 to 20)')
        continue
    break
print('Your shoe size is: ' + shoeSize)
