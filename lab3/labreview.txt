What is the purpose of using functions in a Python script?
The purpose of a function is to create smaller, reusable pieces of code that allows for easier code management

Write Python code to define a function called greetings() that when called will greet the user by name and on the next line display the current date. [hint: use the os.system() function to display the current date.]
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os

def greetings():
    user = os.getuser()
    date = os.system('date')
    print('Greetings ' + user)
    print(date)

Why is it useful for functions to accept arguments passed-up upon function execution?
It's useful to create functions that accept arguments because it helps with error checking

What is the purpose of the import command? What can be the consequence if the import command is not used prior to running a function by name?
The import command is used to allow you to run functions found in other python scripts. When you don't run an import before running the function you will get an error because it doesn't have the required function that you want to run.

Write Python code to declare a function called join() that accepts two arguments which will be be stored as word1 and word2 respectively during the execution of the function.
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def join(word1, word2)
    print(word1 + ' ' + word2)


What is the command to return a value from a function?
return

What is the purpose of the system() function in the os module?
The system() function in the os module allows you to run commands on the command line.

What is the purpose of a list object?
The list object is a data structure similar to an array but there are different functions that can be done on it.

Assume that the following list has been defined: mylist = [ 'apple', 1, 'grape', 2, 'banana', 3, ]
Based on that, what will the following contain?
mylist[0] - apple
mylist[3] - 2
mylist[-1] - 3
mylist[0:1] - apple

Assume that the following list has been defined: combined_list = [ [7, 5], ['x', 'y'], [ 5, 'f' ] ]
Based on that, what will the following contain?
combined_list[0] - [7, 5]
combined_list[1] - ['x', 'y']
combined_list[1][0] - x
combined_list[2][0:2] - [ 5, 'f' ]

Briefly explain the purpose of each of the following methods that can be used with lists: append, insert, remove, sort, copy.
append - add value to end of list
insert - add value to start of list
remove - remove certain value(first instance) from list
sort - sort list
copy - create copy of list

Write the functions that perform the following operations on a list:
Returns the length of the list - len(list)
Returns the smallest value in the list - min(list)
Returns the largest value in the list - max(list)

Write a Python script to display all of the items in a simple list, one item per line.
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def display_list(list)
    for value in list:
        print(value)
