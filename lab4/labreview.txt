What is the purpose of a tuple? How does a tuple differ from a list?
A tuple is another data structure that can store multiple types of data. A tuple is different from a list in the fact that it is immutable

How do you define elements within a tuple?
You define elements with () rather than [] that you would find in a list

Write Python code to confirm if the string 'OPS435' exists within the tuple called courses.
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def search(courses):
    print('OPS435' in courses)

What is the purpose of a set? How do sets differ from lists or tuples?
Sets is a data structure that is unordered and it cannot contain duplicate values

How do you define elements within a set?
Elements are defined using {}

Assuming you have defined two sets called set1 and set2. Write Python code to:
Return a set containing all values of both sets
Returns a set containing all values in set1 that are not found in set2
Return a set containing all values that both sets DO NOT share

#!/usr/bin/env python3
print(set1 + set2)
print(set1.difference(set2))
print(set1.symmetric_difference(set2))

What is the purpose of a dictionary?
A set is a data structure that is unordered, but can be useful in that you can grab any value as long as you know the key, rather than refering to index.

How do you define elements within a dictionary?
Elements can be defined using {}, but each index is key value pair. 

Write Python commands to display for a dictionary called my_dictionary the dictionary key called my_key and a dictionary value for that key?
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print(my_dictionary['my_key'])

What is the purpose for the range(), len(), append(), and map() functions for a dictionary?

range() - can be used to generate key:value in a dictionary
len() - return number of key:value pairs
append() - add key value pair to end of dictionary
map() - run a function within each item in an iterable

List and briefly explain the following string methods:
lower() , upper() , swapcase() , title() , captilize() , split()
lower() - change string to all lowercase
upper() - change string to all uppercase
swapcase() - swap case on all characters in a string
title - change first letter of each string to capital
captilize - change first word's first letter to capital

Assume you issued the following command in your ipython3 shell:
course_name = 'Programming with Python'
What will be the output for each of the following Python commands?
course_name[3:11] - gramming
course_name[10:] - ng
course_name[-1] - g

Create a string object text = "Seneca" in the Python Interactive shell and study the string methods: text.find(), text.count() using the built-in help() function.

text.find() - find index of argument
text.count() - count number of argument occurances
